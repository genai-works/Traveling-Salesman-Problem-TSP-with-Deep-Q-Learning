# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-with-Deep-Q-Learning
In this project, we tackle TSP using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn an optimal path between cities. The Q-network helps the agent (salesman) learn which city to visit next based on the distances between cities, minimizing the total travel distance.
